	  This program includes CS math functions for data manipulation.  Using 
	  the function, changeOfBase(), numerical data, represented as a string,
	  can be converted from any base to any base between 2 and 36.

	  This program also has the capability of taking an an integer number
	  and building a sequence of bytes that can be stored in little or big
	  endian byte order.  Using displayByteSequence(), you have the option
	  to display a byte sequence to the console in decimal or hexadecimal,
	  delimited by the user's choice of a comma, space and comma, or no
	  delimiter at all.
