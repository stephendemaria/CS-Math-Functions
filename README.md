# NumbertoByteSequence
This program takes an integer number and builds a sequence of bytes that can be stored in a file in little or big endian byte order.  It includes the option to display the sequence of bytes to the console in decimal or hexadecimal, delimited by the user's choice of a comma, space and comma, or no delimiter at all.
